## [PlanetCalc](https://planetcalc.com/7842/) has another tool that is perfect for this.

Immediately we can tell that this is a Pigpen cipher. Using the tool linked above, we can start to decode the message. However, as soon as the first word we can see that the output doesn't make a lot of sense. Let's change the [variation](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/pigpen-cipher) of Pigpen that we are using. Change the `Cipher Key` to `Traditional (# X # X) Pigpen` and the message decodes perfectly. <br>
