# Decoding 4 (Hard)
## We have intercepted a message between two hackers. We doubt they're sharing the instrumentals to their latest mixtape. See if you can uncover some meaning behind this.
- `What is the hidden flag in the music?`

---

## The message can be decoded using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

### `What is the plaintext of the message: drivkfoo?`
Drop down the "Encryption / Encoding" tab in CyberChef and go through each one that doesn't require some sort of key. Eventually you will use [Atbash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash). <br>
