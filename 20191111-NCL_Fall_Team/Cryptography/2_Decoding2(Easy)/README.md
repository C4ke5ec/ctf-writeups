The message just useses the NATO phonetic alphabet. You can simply type out the first character of every word to generate our message. <br><br>Inputing the string into the converter, [Cryptii](https://cryptii.com/pipes/nato-phonetic-alphabet), will output our message. We just need to split it up into words and submit. Also, they used "Alpha" instead of "Alfa". So that may just be another version of the NATO phonetic alphabet... or a mistake.<br>
