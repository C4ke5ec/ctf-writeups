# Cracking 2 (Medium)
## A wireless network was hacked. See if you can figure out what happened.

-	What channel was the victim network operating on?
-	What is the ESSID of the wifi network that was hacked?
-	What is the MAC address of the victim that was deauthenticated?
-	What is the wireless password?

###	What channel was the victim network operating on?
Looking at the Beacon Frame in `Tagged parameters` we can see the network channel. <br>
DS Parameter set: `2`
###	What is the ESSID of the wifi network that was hacked?
SSID Parameter: `Holloween Town`
###	What is the MAC address of the victim that was deauthenticated?
Same method used in Cracking1.
`f4:6e:28:9f:ef:96`
###	What is the wireless password?
I started with `$ aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt crack2.cap` but it was taking too long so I came up with another way. Hashcat has the ability to convert a `.pcap` file into a `.hccapx` file which is the filetype required by hashcat. Convienently, hashcat provides an online [tool](https://hashcat.net/cap2hccapx/) to convert these capture files into the required format.

Once the file is converted, you can run hashcat on it and find the plaintext password much faster.

It'll take a while if you're not using a GPU... <br>
```
$ hashcat -m 2500 crack2.hccapx rockyou.txt
