# Decoding 2 (Easy)
## Our officers have obtained some encrypted messages. See if you can decode them.
- `Gurer ner gra pbagnvaref ehaavat`
- `Lzwjw sjw wayzl UNWk xgj lzsl kwjnwj nwjkagf`

## All messages can be decoded using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

### `Gurer ner gra pbagnvaref ehaavat`
Since this is rated easy and the first letter is capitalized, my first thought is to go ahead and do a rotaiton cipher. Using ROT13 turns out to give us the decoded message. <br>
`There are ten containers running`

### `Lzwjw sjw wayzl UNWk xgj lzsl kwjnwj nwjkagf`
Since the last one was a ROT13, there is a good chance that this is probably some variation. Running through the options, we find that ROT8 gives us the decoded message. <br>
`There are eight CVEs for that server version`
