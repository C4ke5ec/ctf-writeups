# Gems (Easy)
## We have found this gem of a program that contains a flag, help us answer a few questions about its behavior.

-	What language is the program written in?
-	What data type does check_flag? Return?
-	What is the flag hidden in the program?

---

###	What language is the program written in?
The title of the challenge is Gems and the code looks really stupid... so it must be RUBY!

`Ruby`
###	What data type does check_flag? Return?
`puts "You got the flag!" && exit if ans` is testing for true or false. So the return type must be <br>
`boolean`
###	What is the flag hidden in the program?
In the interest of time I ended up just brute-forcing the flag. <br>
`flag = [ 210, 202, 216, 172, 198, 196, 204, 210, 172, 185, 183, 182, 178 ]`
