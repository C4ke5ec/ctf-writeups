# Helper (Hard)
## The Metropolis City IT department has received a few suspicious files on the network claiming to be PC helpers that will boost the performance of the computer they're installed on, but the only thing that they're doing is raising eyebrows over their suspicious behavior. If prompted, use uid value: 5ae43a11a0d1dd81007ac0f90f8be168

-	What is the name and full version number of the operating system that compiled this binary?
-	How many minutes does the program stay dormant for?
-	What is the hostname that the program attempts to contact?
-	What is the port that the program attempts to contact?
-	What data is being exfiltrated to the remote server?

###	What is the name and full version number of the operating system that compiled this binary?
First thing to do would be to run strings on the file. We see a certain line that stands out
```
GCC: (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1
16.04.11) 5.4.0 20160609
```
It looks like the binary was compiled using [GCC](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gcc) on: `Ubuntu 16.04` 

###	How many minutes does the program stay dormant for?
This can be found by loading the program up in a RE program like [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/).

**Disclaimer: This gets kind of confusing... And is oversimplified.**

1. First thing we are going to do is look for the `entry` of the program. This can be found at the top of our `Listing` windows. The entry is where the program tells the operating system to start executing code.
2. Double click on the `entry` and we will be taken to our first function. Looking in our `Decompile` window, we see that a few other functions called in this one. We will double click on the first function, `FUN_00400e66` on my computer, and it will take us to a new function.
3. In our new function, we scroll down and see `sleep(0x31380)` being called. Scrolling over it, Ghidra will tell us that the decimal value of the hex is `201600`. This value is in seconds so all we have to do is convert it to minutes and we get our time in minutes that the program stays dormant. <br>
`3360` minutes
