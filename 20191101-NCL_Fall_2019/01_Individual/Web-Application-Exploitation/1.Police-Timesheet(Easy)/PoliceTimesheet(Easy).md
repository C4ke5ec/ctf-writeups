###	What is the Precinct Captain's username?
Entering dummy information into the username and password brings up an error.
```
Incorrect Credentials
Unauthorized access of this system is against Metropolis City Ordinance ยง13.37. Contact the Precinct Captain ray_holt99 for any assistance.
```
`ray_holt99` is the username we are looking for.

###	What is the name of the web framework that is powering the server?
There are two ways to find this.
1. WhatWeb - `whatweb https://db0a8981daab40e2ba5407d1c7dd2b89-policephr.web.cityinthe.cloud/` will return the framework.
2. Using the Wappalyzer plugin for chrome. It works really well at detecting things like web frameworks, web servers, programming languages, libraries, and even proxies.

`express` is the framework.
