## The Metropolis Police Department has identified a lead on potential MongoDB database cluster storing personal information stolen by the hacker group liber8tion. They tried to connect to datastore.liber8tion.cityinthe.cloudbut have not had success, can you help them identify how to potentially access the database cluster?

-	How many nodes are in the database cluster?
-	What is the IP address of the most preferred node?
-	What is the IP address of the least preferred node?
